\chapter{Related Work}

This chapter presents a summary of previous work that is most relevant to our methods. The two key components of our computational tools are physical simulation and controller optimization. We will begin with a brief review of related work in these two fields. Since the ultimate goal of our research is an end-to-end computational framework that can autonomously design robotic controllers from high-level task specifications, we need to transfer the controllers found in the simulation to the real robots. We will conclude this chapter with an overview of related works in controller transfer from virtual to real environments in robotics.

\section{Physical Simulation}
In order to simulate the physical environment, researchers often borrow numerical tools from the applied mathematics literature. The most widely used methods include Eulerian methods \cite{Foster:1996,stam99stablefluids}, Lagrangian methods \cite{Premzoe03,Muller:2003}, Hybrid methods \cite{Fan:2013} and position-based dynamics \cite{Muller:2007,Macklin:2014}. These methods have produced realistic simulations for a wide variety of dynamical systems, such as rigid bodies, deformable bodies, fluids and clothes. In the next few sections, we will focus on simulation of fluids, soft bodies, contacts and bicycle dynamics, which are used in our work.

\subsection{Fluids}

Simulating fluids involves numerically solving the governing equations of motions, Navier-Stokes equations. Two popular methods in computer animation are Lagrangian method and Eulerian method. The Lagrangian approach treats the fluid as a particle system \cite{Monaghan:1992,Premzoe03,Muller:2003,Raveendran:2011}. In contrast, the Eulerian approach treats the fluid as a continuous velocity field discretized
on a computational grid. Foster and Metaxas's work \cite{Foster:1996} was the first that
solved the full 3D Navier-Stokes equations to animate fluids.
Stam \cite{stam99stablefluids} improved it, achieving unconditionally
numerical stability by introducing the semi-Lagrangian
method for the convection term and implicit solver for
the viscosity and pressure terms. Although the Eulerian method is more computationally expensive, it has produced stunning visual results when simulating a wide range of physical phenomena, including fire and smoke\cite{Nguyen:2002,Fedkiw:2001}, explosion \cite{Yngve:2000}, surface tension \cite{Hong:2005,Wang:2005}, non-Newtonian fluid \cite{Goktekin:2004,Bargteil:2007} and multi-phase flow \cite{Losasso:2006,Ando:2015}. We choose to use the Eulerian method in Chapter 3 because it is easier to enforce the incompressibility condition of fluids, which turns out to be important in swimming motions. 

When studying swimming motions, simulating fluids alone is not enough. Swimming involves two-way interactions between the character and the fluid. Accurately modeling this two-way interaction is essential to simulate swimming motions. Many researchers have proposed various ways to
simulate the two-way coupling between fluids and solids.  Takahashi et al. \cite{takahashi2002fluid-rigid}
presented a simple alternating two-way coupling method. The velocities of the solid
objects served as the boundary conditions for the fluid motion while the
pressure field solved from the Navier-Stokes equations was integrated at the
solid surface to provide a net force and a net torque exerted on the solid
objects. Arash et al. \cite{arash2003simulatingfluid-solid} represented the solids by mass-spring models and fluids by marker particles.  The interactions were calculated through the mutual forces between the marker particles and mass nodes at the interface. Carlson et al. \cite{carlson2004rigid} proposed the rigid
fluid method that treated solids as fluids at first
and then projected the velocity field in the solid region onto a subspace
satisfying the rigid constraints. Guendelman et al. \cite{guendelman2005thin} made use of an
alternating approach that was generalized to include octree and thin
shells.  They solved the pressure field for a
second time by adding solid masses to the fluid grid density, which improves
the pressure field. Klingner et al. \cite{klingner2006mesh} used a tetrahedral mesh for accurate boundary discretization and extended the mass conservation (projection) step
to include the dynamics of rigid body. This was extended to model the interaction between fluids and deformable bodies \cite{chentanez2006simultaneous}. Batty et al. \cite{batty2007fast} derived a fast variationl approach that allowed sub-grid accuray using regular grids. Robinson et al. \cite{robinson2008two} developed a generic and momentum
conserving technique to couple fluids to rigid/deformable solids and thin
shells. The coupled system is symmetric indefinite and solved using MINRES. Our two-way coupling technique resembles that of Klingner et al. \cite{klingner2006mesh}. The main difference is that we simulate the interaction between fluids and articulated rigid bodies instead of rigid bodies. Furthermore, our represent of the articulated rigid body in the generalized coordinates further complicates the swimming simulation.

\subsection{Soft Bodies}
In Chapter 4, we study the locomotion on land for soft body characters. To simulate the squishy characters, we need a physical model for deformable objects.
Since the seminal work introduced by Terzpoulos
\cite{Terzopoulos:1987}, researchers in computer graphics have
simulated a wide variety of deformable phenomena including cloth
\cite{Baraff:1998,Bridson:2002}, elasticity \cite{Muller:2002}, and
plasticity \cite{O'Brien:1999,Bargteil:2007}. Although mass-spring systems \cite{Provot:1996,Liu:2013} are
widely-used due to its simplicity, it is difficult to
specify the spring stiffness to capture the desired material property. A more accurate technique is
the Finite Element Method (FEM) \cite{Bathe:2007}, which typically uses a
tetrahedral mesh to find weak solutions of the dynamic
equations. The robustness of FEM simulation can be improved by
handling inverted tetrahedra \cite{Irving:2004}, remeshing
ill-conditioned elements \cite{Bargteil:2007}, or preserving volume
without locking artifacts \cite{Irving:2007}. To improve the
performance of FEM simulation, linear strain model and precomputed
stiff matrix are often used. However, these models are only valid for
small deformations. To simulate large deformations, M\"{u}ller \etal
\cite{Muller:2002} proposed a corotational method to fix the
volume inflation artifacts. Nesme \etal \cite{NPF05} suggested
that linearization around the current deformed configuration reduces
ghost torques. Precomputed deformation modes have also been used to
interactively deform large structures
\cite{James:2003,Barbic:2005,Kim:2009}. In our work, we choose to use the corotational linear FEM \cite{Muller:2002,NPF05}
to simulate the soft body dynamics. We also use implicit integration to further increase the simulation stability and speed.

\subsection{Contact Modeling}
Locomotion on land is achieved by a character actively and purposefully pushing the ground. As a result, an equal and opposite ground reaction force is exerted on the character through the contacts and changes its center of mass. Modelling contacts between two dynamic systems is an active research area in physical simulation. Early simulations use penalty forces \cite{Terzopoulos:1987}, whose magnitude is proportional to the depth of penetration. Despite its simplicity, this method requires stringent simulation time steps and careful parameter tunning. More recently, constraint-based methods, such as linear complementarity problem (LCP), are used to handle contacts. Stewart and Trinkle proposed an
LCP formulation using an implicit time-stepping method to guarantee
non-penetration, directional friction, and approximated Coulomb's
friction cone conditions \cite{Stewart:1996}. Based on the LCP
framework, many improved contact models were introduced recently in
computer graphics, including using an efficient iterative method
\cite{Erleben:2007}, a simple staggered sequence of projections
\cite{Kaufman:2008}, or a progressive constrained manifold
refinement \cite{Otaduy:2009}. Our implementation of contact handling in Chapter 4 is based on the LCP condition \cite{Tan:2012}, which is solved using Lemke's algorithm.

\subsection{Bicycle Dynamics} In Chapter 5, we study human riding a bicycle. Accurately modeling the bicycle dynamics is important in this research. Early studies of bicycle dynamics date back to more than a century ago. As described in Meijaard et al. \cite{Meijaard2007}, Whipple \cite{Whipple1899} and Carvallo \cite{Carvallo1900} independently derived the first governing equations of bicycle dynamics. These equations were revised to account for the drag forces \cite{Collins1963}, tire slip \cite{Singh1964} and the presence of a rider \cite{van1975method}. Rankine \cite{Rankine1870} discussed the balance strategy of ``steering towards the direction of falling'', which forms the foundation of many studies on bicycle balance control, including ours. Despite this long history of research and the seemingly simple mechanics of bicycles, some physical phenomena exhibited by the bicycle movement still remain mysterious. One example is the self-stable characteristic of bicycles: A moving bicycle within a narrow range of forward speed can automatically correct its falling motion without any human intervention. In addition to the early belief that this phenomenon was attributed to gyroscopic effects of the rotating wheels \cite{Klein1910} or the \emph{trail}\footnote{The trail is the distance between the front wheel ground contact point and the steering axis.} \cite{Jones1970}, Kooijman et al. \cite{Kooijman2011} showed that the mass distribution over the whole bicycle also contributes to the self-stability. Even though the dynamic equations provide us with some intuition, we do not solve them directly in our work because they are tailored specifically to normal riding situations where both tires touch the ground. This will be a major restriction in bicycle stunts. Instead, we modify a generic physical simulator, Open Dynamic Engine (ODE) \cite{ode:2008}, to model the bicycle dynamics.

\section{Controller Optimization}

Controlling character locomotion has been extensively studied in both computer animation and robotics. Starting from the seminal work of Hodgins et al. \cite{Hodgins:1995:AHA} which demonstrated sophisticated biped
controllers, such as gymnastic vaulting or tumbling, researchers have investigated different forms of locomotion, including walking \cite{Yin:2007,Wang:2012}, running \cite{Hodgins:1995:AHA,Kwon:2010}, flying \cite{Wu:2003} and swimming \cite{Grzeszczuk:1995}.  We refer the readers to an update-to-date review \cite{Geijtenbeek2012a} on physically-based character animation.

Two main categories of methods for controller optimization are trajectory optimization and reinforcement learning. Trajectory optimization was introduced more than two decades ago to generate physically plausible character animations \cite{Witkin:1988}. The user provides the start and the end configurations of the character and an objective function, this method generates trajectories of joint angles by minimize the objective function subject to the physical constraints. Trajectory optimization has been applied to control the iconic jumping Luxo Jr lamp \cite{Witkin:1988}, humanoid characters \cite{Liu:2002,Jain:2009,Ye:2010}, and characters with arbitrary morphologies \cite{Wampler:2009}. The resulting motions are physically plausible and follow the animation principles such as anticipation and follow-through \cite{thomas:1995}. However, trajectory optimization often leads to large optimization problems, which is time-consuming to solve and the solutions could often stuck at local minima.

Reinforcement learning algorithms optimize controllers by formulating and solving a Markov Decision Process (MDP). It finds optimal actions at different states. If the transition model is known, value iteration is a popular method. Researchers have successfully applied (fitted) value iteration to generalize motion capture data \cite{Treuille:2007:NCA,Levine:2012:CCC}, to carry out locomotion tasks \cite{Coros:2009:RTC}, and to manipulate objects with hands \cite{Multifinger2013}. Applying value iteration to continuous state and action spaces is nontrivial because discretizing the space does not scale well to high dimensions \cite{Sutton:1998:IRL} and using function approximation often converges to a poor local minimum or might not converge at all \cite{Thrun93issuesin,Boyan95generalizationin}. Policy search \cite{Ng:2000:PPS} is another reinforcement learning algorithm, which can be easily generalized to high-dimensional continuous space. It directly searches for a mapping between the state space and the action space, without the need to construct a value function. Many studies on locomotion control \cite{Yin08,Wang:2009,Coros:2011,Wang:2012,Geijtenbeek:2013} performed policy search on parameterized controllers. However, the policy parametrization need to be carefully designed because policy search can only search the control space defined by the parametrization. A poorly designed parametrization could eliminate effective controllers or introduce too many local minima to the control space. In Chapter 5, we will discuss how to automatically design controller parametrizations. Given a parametrization, one popular optimizer for policy search is Covariance Matrix Adaptation (CMA) \cite{hansen2004evaluating}. It is a stochastic optimization algorithm, which has been proven effective even when the problem domain is highly discontinuous \cite{Wu:2010:TAB,Wang:2010,Mordatch:2010:RPL}. While most of the related work mentioned above is in the field of character animation, interested readers can find surveys of reinforcement learning in robotics \cite{Bagnell:2013}. Next, we will review the related works that are specific to the locomotion tasks in the dissertation.

\subsection{Locomotion in Hydrodynamic Environments}

Tu and Terzopoulos pioneered the animation of swimming fish using a a
mass-spring system for the fish body and a simplified fluid
model~\cite{tu1994artificial,terzopoulos1994artificial,Grzeszczuk95automatedlearning}. They used simulated annealing and the simplex method to discover swimming gaits. Their simulation also incorporated vision sensors, motor controllers, and behavioral modeling
of eating, escape, schooling and mating.  The
major difference between their paper and ours lies in the fluid model and the optimization technique. This early paper used a
simplified fluid model while ours adopts a full Navier-Stokes solver and introduces a two-way coupling method between
fluids and articulated figures in generalized coordinate.

Sims \cite{sims1994creatures} investigated the simulated evolution of
creature locomotion.  Sims' creatures were composed
of blocks that are connected by articulated joints. He used genetic
programming to evolve both the creature bodies and their controllers.  In
addition to walking and jumping behaviors, some of his creatures also
learned to swim in a simplified fluid environment.

Wu and Popovi\'{c} \cite{Wu:2003} used an articulated skeleton and deformable elements for
feathers in order to animate the flight of birds.
They used an optimization process to find the best wing beats in order to
accurately follow a given path.  Yang et al. \cite{yang2004layered} used an articulated body
representation, a simplified fluid model, and several layers of control to
model human swimmers. Si et al. \cite{Si:2014} applied a biologically motivated Central Pattern Generator (CPG) to control human swimming motions. Although they simulated the fluid by solving Navier-Stokes equations, their two-way coupling method was based on the simplified model. Kwatra et al. \cite{kwatra2009fluid} used an
articulated body representation and two-way coupling between the body and a
fluid simulation to model human swimming.  They used
motion capture data of swimming motions as input to the swimmer control.
Lentine et al. \cite{lentine2010creature} used an articulated skeleton with a deformable skin layer and
two-way coupling to a fluid simulator to model figures that are moving in
fluids.  They optimized for certain styles of
motion using objective functions designed for effort minimization and drag
minimization/maximization.  Their results also clearly demonstrated that
using a full fluid simulator gives more realistic results than using a
simplified fluid model.

In the field of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), there is a small but
growing literature on the simulation of swimming creatures.  These studies
are typically focused on a single swimming style of one particular creature,
and they usually make use of sophisticated fluid dynamics code, at a large cost in
computational complexity, to generate more accurate and detailed fluid simulation. Often these studies are informed by laboratory
studies of the creature in question, including flow data that has been
gathered using methods such as particle image
velocimetry~\cite{grant1997particle}.  A good representative of such work is
the investigation of Shiragaonkar et al. of the knifefish, which is a fish
that propels itself using waves that travel along its elongated lower fin
(gymnotiform swimming)~\cite{shirgaonkar2008hydrodynamics}.  The simulator
for this work used an immersed boundary method, and the simulations were
performed on a 262 compute node Linux cluster.  Another example of such a
study is the work of Kern and Koumoutakos \cite{kern2006simulations} on the simulation of eels
(anguilliform swimming).  In this work, the fluid
grid is matched to the eel body by using a cylindrical grid in most of the
domain and a hemisphere-based grid for the head of the eel.  They used the
CMA technique~\cite{hansen2004evaluating} to optimize a five parameter
motion model.

\subsection{Locomotion for Soft Body Characters}

Controlling physically simulated soft bodies is a practical problem in
computer animation. Previous work offers a rich repertoire of
techniques that enable the artists to control the shape of soft
bodies. Many methods proposed to track a given input animation or
keyframes using interpolated resting shapes \cite{Kondo:2005}, a
constrained Lagrangian solver \cite{Bergou:2007}, a linear quadratic
regulator \cite{Barbic:2008}, or reduced spacetime optimization
\cite{Barbic:2009}. Martin \etal \cite{Martin:2011} introduced an
example-based approach for simulating soft bodies with desired
behaviors. The user supplies the system with a few poses to guide the
simulation results toward preferred shapes. Shape control for soft
bodies has also been applied to physics-based facial
animation. Sifakis \cite{Sifakis:2005} formulated an optimization
to automatically determine muscle activation that tracks a sparse set
of motion capture markers.

In contrast to shape control, locomotion control for soft bodies is
relatively less explored in computer animation. Previous work has shown that mass-spring systems can be used to simulate motion of worms, snakes, and fish
\cite{Miller:1988,Tu:1994,Grzeszczuk:1995}. Miller
\cite{Miller:1988} utilized anisotropic frictional forces such
that a worm can slide forward by contracting elastic body segments. Tu
and Terzopoulos \cite{Tu:1994} applied a simple fluid dynamic
model to provide forward thrust when a fish deforms its body. Kim and Pollard \cite{Kim:2011:DCO,Kim:2011} demonstrated
that much more complex locomotion can be achieved by effective soft
body control. They combined an efficient skeleton-driven FEM simulator
and an optimization-based controller to create many interesting
behaviors, such as a star fish crawling out of a box and a fish
flipping back and forth. More recently, Schulz et al. \cite{Schulz:2014} animated the soft body locomotion using spacetime optimization.

Although there are a large amount of related work in locomotion control for characters that are represented as articulated rigid bodies, there is one important difference in controlling soft body locomotion: we cannot apply the commonly-used joint torques to soft body characters. We need different actuation signals. For example, Coros et al. \cite{Coros:2012} used dynamically changing rest shapes as actuation signals to control locomotion. Another actuation signal is muscle contraction. One important contribution of our work in Chapter 4 is a muscle model. Previous work has modeled dynamics of muscles and
demonstrated that complex interplay among bones, muscles, ligaments and
other soft tissues can be modeled for individual body parts, including
the neck \cite{Lee:2006}, the upper body
\cite{Zordan:2006,Dilorenzo:2008,Lee:2009:CBM}, and hands
\cite{Tsang:2005,Sueda:2008}. Using the volumetric data from the
visible human data set, Teran \etal integrated a B-spline
representation for muscles, a tetrahedra mesh for soft tissues, and a
triangulated surface for each bone to simulate musculoskeletal
behaviors \cite{Teran:2003,Teran:2005}. A striking difference of our
work is that we focus on controlling deformation behaviors without
skeletal support. This type of control mechanism resembles
biomechanical movements using muscular-hydrostats, such as the
tentacles of cephalopod mollusks or the trunks of elephants
\cite{Kier:1985}. By using muscle contraction alone, we can generate
functional motor skills, including elongating, shortening,
bending, and twisting. We show that visually appealing behaviors that
cannot be produced by skeleton-based systems emerge with
appropriate control.

The main difficulty in
locomotion is to control an under-actuated system by exploiting
external contact forces. Velocity-based LCPs for contact
modeling can have infinitely many solutions, but general LCP solvers,
such as Lemke's algorithm, are incapable of ascertaining the quality of
the solutions for a given criterion. This drawback is particularly
undesirable when solving an optimal control problem that exploits the
contact and dynamic state of the system. One approach to this problem is contact-invariant optimization \cite{Mordatch:2012,Mordatch:2013}. Due to the lack of robust
schemes to formulate optimization with arbitrary objective function
and linear complementarity constraints, many previous methods
explicitly assumed that the contacts remain static
\cite{Abe:2007,Jain:2009,Kim:2011:DCO} while optimizing control forces
subject to equations of motion. This assumption significantly
restricts the effectiveness of the controller for locomotion and balance
because the controller is not allowed to actively exploit contact
breakage, slipping contacts, or rolling contacts to achieve control
goals. A few previous studies in mathematics addressed the problems of
linear and convex quadratic programs with complementarity constraints
(LPCCs and QPCCs) \cite{Hu:2008,Bai:2011}. They showed that global resolution of
nonconvex problems in these two subclasses, including those infeasible
and unbounded, can be accomplish in finite time. In Chapter 4, we introduce an efficient QPCC solver for controller optimization problems with contacts. 

\subsection{Locomotion with a Passive Mechanical Device} Compared to walking and running, fewer studies focus on locomotion that involves a character controlling another device with complex dynamics. Van de Panne and Lee \cite{vandepanne:2003} built a 2D ski simulator and that relies on user inputs to control the character. This work was later extended to 3D by Zhao and Van de Panne \cite{Zhao:2005}. Planar motions, including pumping a swing, riding a seesaw and even pedaling a unicycle, were studied \cite{Hodgins:1992}. Hodgins et al. \cite{Hodgins:1995:AHA} demonstrated that normal cycling activities, including balance and steering, can be achieved using simple proportional-derivative (PD) controllers for the handlebar angle. These linear feedback controllers are sufficient for normal cycling, but they cannot generate the bicycle stunts demonstrated in Chapter 5.

One central problem of riding a bicycle is to keep balance. The balance problem has been studied extensively in previous work on locomotion synthesis. Balance can be maintained by exerting virtual forces \cite{Pratt2001,Coros2010}, applying linear feedback \cite{Laszlo:1996,Yin:2007,daSilva:2008,Coros2010}, using nonlinear control policies \cite{Muico:2009}, planning the contact forces \cite{Muico:2009,Tan:2012}, employing reduced models \cite{Tsai:2010,Kwon:2010,Mordatch:2010:RPL,Coros2010,Ye:2010} and training in stochastic environments \cite{Wang:2010}.

The bicycle control problem has been investigated in the reinforcement learning literature. Randl$\o$v and Alstr$\o$m \cite{RandlovAlstrom:1998} used SARSA($\lambda$), a model free reinforcement learning algorithm, to learn to balance a bicycle and ride to a goal. This algorithm requires a large number of simulation trials and the converged result is still not ideal. Ng and Jordan \cite{Ng:2000:PPS} applied policy search to the same bicycle learning problem. They parameterized the policy with neural networks and used the policy gradient to find the optimal network weights. The resulting controller significantly outperformed the results in the previous study. Our method is inspired by the policy search algorithm. However, to adopt this algorithm to learn more challenging tasks, we need to overcome two difficulties: First, we do not have reliable policy gradient information because of the frequent contact events. Second, we do not know a good policy parametrization, which is difficult to design manually by trial and error for each bicycle stunt. We use NEAT \cite{Stanley:2002:ENN} to address both difficulties. NEAT was first introduced to graphics by Allen and Faloutsos \cite{Allen2009}. They used it to evolve locomotion controllers but were not able to achieve stable and sustained walking.

\section{Controller Transfer from Virtual Characters to Real Robots}
Research in computer animation has demonstrated robust locomotion control for challenging tasks in physically simulated environments. However, we have not seen any robots that can demonstrate similar capabilities. This gap is known as \emph{Reality Gap}: A controller that can work effectively in physical simulation may not work in the real environment. This gap is caused by sensor noise, latency, hardware limitations, unmodeled dynamics, inaccurate physical model and other unknown factors. Nolfi and Floreano \cite{Nolfi:2000} outlined the problems that are related to crossing the Reality Gap and identified the key difficulties. A large amount of approaches were proposed in robotics to cross this Reality Gap. We refer the readers to Eaton \cite{Eaton:2015} for a comprehensive review of this topic.

One way to cross the Reality Gap is to increase the robustness of the controller so that it is more likely to work in a different environment. A more robust controller can be found by injecting noise to the simulation \cite{Miglino94,Jakobi95,Miglino96}, leveraging multiple simulators \cite{Boeing:2012}, and optimizing the controller through ensembles of perturbed models \cite{Mordatch:2015}. Although these methods do not explicitly involve experiments on the robot during controller optimization, they have been shown effective to increase the probability of a successful controller transfer.

Another direction to close the Reality Gap is to improve the simulation model so that it better reflects the real world dynamics. The simulation is improved by measuring and minimizing the discrepancy between the simulation results and the data collected in robot experiments. Ha and Yamane \cite{HA:2015} modeled this discrepancy using Gaussian process. Abbeel et al. \cite{Abbeel:2006} used an inaccurate physical model but successively grounded the policy evaluations using real-life trials. Mouret et al. \cite{MouretKD13, Koos:2010} derived a measure of transferability by comparing fitness scores between the simulation and the real experiments. Grounded simulated learning approach \cite{Farchy:2013} iteratively optimized the controller, measured the discrepancy and modified the simulator using supervised learning algorithms. Bongard and Lipson \cite{BongardL05} coevolved the controller and the simulator using an iterative estimation-exploration process. Similarly, Zagal et al. \cite{zagal2004} introduced the ``back-to-reality'' approach, which also involved the coevolution but used a different measure of discrepancy. In Chapter 6, we investigate several factors that contribute to the Reality Gap and we present a simulation calibration process to transfer locomotion controllers from virtual to real environments.
